            <h1>C-Sharp / C#</h1>
            <h2>Created By: Mads Torgersen, Anders Hejlsberg</h2>
            <p>C# is a general-purpose high-level programming language supporting multiple paradigms.</p>
            <p>C# encompasses static typing, strong typing, lexically scoped, imperative, declarative, functional, generic, object-oriented (class-based), and component-oriented programming disciplines.</p>
            <p>The C# programming language was designed by Anders Hejlsberg from Microsoft in 2000 and was later approved as an international standard by Ecma (ECMA-334) in 2002 and ISO/IEC (ISO/IEC 23270) in 2003.</p>
            <p>Microsoft introduced C# along with .NET Framework and Visual Studio, both of which were closed-source.</p>
            <p>Four years later, in 2004, a free and open-source project called Mono began, providing a cross-platform compiler and runtime environment for the C# programming language.</p>
            <p>A decade later, Microsoft released Visual Studio Code (code editor), Roslyn (compiler), and the unified .NET platform (software framework), all of which support C# and are free, open-source, and cross-platform.</p>
