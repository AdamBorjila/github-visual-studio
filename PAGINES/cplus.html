            <p>C++ is a high-level general-purpose programming language. It was created by Danish computer scientist Bjarne Stroustrup and first released in 1985 as an extension of the C programming language. C++ now has object-oriented, generic, and functional features in addition to facilities for low-level 
                memory manipulation. It is almost always implemented as a compiled language, and many vendors provide C++ compilers. C++ was designed with systems programming and embedded, resource-constrained software and large systems in mind, with performance, efficiency, and flexibility of use as its design highlights. C++ is 
                standardized by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), with the latest standard version ratified and published by ISO in December 2020 as ISO/IEC 14882:2020. 
                The current C++20 standard supersedes the previous versions with new features and an enlarged standard library.</p>
